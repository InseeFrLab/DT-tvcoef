	Abstract = {The Diebold-Mariano (DM) test was intended for comparing forecasts; it has been, and remains, useful in that regard. The DM test was not intended for comparing models. Unfortunately, however, much of the large subsequent literature uses DM-type tests for comparing models, in (pseudo-) out-of-sample environments. In that case, much simpler yet more compelling full-sample model comparison procedures exist; they have been, and should continue to be, widely used. The hunch that (pseudo-) out-of-sample analysis is somehow the "only," or "best," or even a "good" way to provide insurance against in-sample over-fitting in model comparisons proves largely false. On the other hand, (pseudo-) out-of-sample analysis may be useful for learning about comparative historical predictive performance.},

 abstract = {This article derives the large-sample distributions of Lagrange multiplier (LM) tests for parameter instability against several alternatives of interest in the context of cointegrated regression models. The fully modified estimator of Phillips and Hansen is extended to cover general models with stochastic and deterministic trends. The test statistics considered include the SupF test of Quandt, as well as the LM tests of Nyblom and of Nabeya and Tanaka. It is found that the asymptotic distributions depend on the nature of the regressor processes--that is, if the regressors are stochastic or deterministic trends. The distributions are noticeably different from the distributions when the data are weakly dependent. It is also found that the lack of cointegration is a special case of the alternative hypothesis considered (an unstable intercept), so the tests proposed here may also be viewed as a test of the null of cointegration against the alternative of no cointegration. The tests are applied to three data sets--an aggregate consumption function, a present value model of stock prices and dividends, and the term structure of interest rates.},

    abstract = "{This book presents a comprehensive treatment of the state space approach to time series analysis. The distinguishing feature of state space time series models is that observations are regarded as being made up of distinct components such as trend, seasonal, regression elements and disturbance elements, each of which is modelled separately. The techniques that emerge from this approach are very flexible. Part I presents a full treatment of the construction and analysis of linear Gaussian state space models. The methods are based on the Kalman filter and are appropriate for a wide range of problems in practical time series analysis. The analysis can be carried out from both classical and Bayesian perspectives. Part I then presents illustrations to real series and exercises are provided for a selection of chapters. Part II discusses approximate and exact approaches for handling broad classes of non-Gaussian and nonlinear state space models. Approximate methods include the extended Kalman filter and the more recently developed unscented Kalman filter. The book shows that exact treatments become feasible when simulation-based methods such as importance sampling and particle filtering are adopted. Bayesian treatments based on simulation methods are also explored.}",

Now continuous estimates at endpoints are achievable. Under given conditions the use of those quite different weighting functions at an interior point is equivalent. At a boundary point the use of dierent methods will lead to different estimates. It is also shown that the optimal weighting function at the endpoints is a natural extension of one of the optimal weighting functions in the interior. Furthermore, it is shown that the most well known boundary kernels proposed in the literature can be generated by local polynomial regression using corresponding weighting functions. The proposals are particularly useful, when one-side smoothing or de- tection of change points in nonparametric regression are considered.},
