abstract = {Forecast combinations have flourished remarkably in the forecasting community and, in recent years, have become part of mainstream forecasting research and activities. Combining multiple forecasts produced for a target time series is now widely used to improve accuracy through the integration of information gleaned from different sources, thereby avoiding the need to identify a single “best” forecast. Combination schemes have evolved from simple combination methods without estimation to sophisticated techniques involving time-varying weights, nonlinear combinations, correlations among components, and cross-learning. They include combining point forecasts and combining probabilistic forecasts. This paper provides an up-to-date review of the extensive literature on forecast combinations and a reference to available open-source software implementations. We discuss the potential and limitations of various methods and highlight how these ideas have developed over time. Some crucial issues concerning the utility of forecast combinations are also surveyed. Finally, we conclude with current research gaps and potential insights for future research.}

ABSTRACT = {Autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) models with time-dependent (td) coefficients and marginally heteroscedastic innovations provide a natural alternative to stationary ARMA models. Several theories have been developed in the last 25 years for parametric estimations in that context. In this paper, we focus on time-dependent autoregressive (tdAR) models and consider one of the estimation theories in that case. We also provide an alternative theory for tdAR processes that relies on a ρ-mixing property. We compare these theories to the Dahlhaus theory for locally stationary processes and the Bibi and Francq theory, made essentially for cyclically time-dependent models, with our own theory. Regarding existing theories, there are differences in the basic assumptions (e.g., on derivability with respect to time or with respect to parameters) that are better seen in specific cases such as the tdAR(1) process. There are also differences in terms of asymptotics, as shown by an example. Our opinion is that the field of application can play a role in choosing one of the theories. This paper is completed by simulation results that show that the asymptotic theory can be used even for short series (less than 50 observations).},

abstract = {Forecasting has always been at the forefront of decision making and planning. The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise risks and maximise utilities. The large number of forecasting applications calls for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle real-life challenges. This article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts. We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to allow the readers to navigate through the various topics. We complement the theoretical concepts and applications covered by large lists of free or open-source software implementations and publicly-available databases.}

	Abstract = {The Diebold-Mariano (DM) test was intended for comparing forecasts; it has been, and remains, useful in that regard. The DM test was not intended for comparing models. Unfortunately, however, much of the large subsequent literature uses DM-type tests for comparing models, in (pseudo-) out-of-sample environments. In that case, much simpler yet more compelling full-sample model comparison procedures exist; they have been, and should continue to be, widely used. The hunch that (pseudo-) out-of-sample analysis is somehow the "only," or "best," or even a "good" way to provide insurance against in-sample over-fitting in model comparisons proves largely false. On the other hand, (pseudo-) out-of-sample analysis may be useful for learning about comparative historical predictive performance.},

 abstract = {This article derives the large-sample distributions of Lagrange multiplier (LM) tests for parameter instability against several alternatives of interest in the context of cointegrated regression models. The fully modified estimator of Phillips and Hansen is extended to cover general models with stochastic and deterministic trends. The test statistics considered include the SupF test of Quandt, as well as the LM tests of Nyblom and of Nabeya and Tanaka. It is found that the asymptotic distributions depend on the nature of the regressor processes--that is, if the regressors are stochastic or deterministic trends. The distributions are noticeably different from the distributions when the data are weakly dependent. It is also found that the lack of cointegration is a special case of the alternative hypothesis considered (an unstable intercept), so the tests proposed here may also be viewed as a test of the null of cointegration against the alternative of no cointegration. The tests are applied to three data sets--an aggregate consumption function, a present value model of stock prices and dividends, and the term structure of interest rates.},

The distinguishing feature of state space time series models is that observations are regarded as being made up of distinct components such as trend, seasonal, regression elements and disturbance elements, each of which is modelled separately. The techniques that emerge from this approach are very flexible. Part I presents a full treatment of the construction and analysis of linear Gaussian state space models. The methods are based on the Kalman filter and are appropriate for a wide range of problems in practical time series analysis. The analysis can be carried out from both classical and Bayesian perspectives. Part I then presents illustrations to real series and exercises are provided for a selection of chapters. Part II discusses approximate and exact approaches for handling broad classes of non-Gaussian and nonlinear state space models. Approximate methods include the extended Kalman filter and the more recently developed unscented Kalman filter. The book shows that exact treatments become feasible when simulation-based methods such as importance sampling and particle filtering are adopted. Bayesian treatments based on simulation methods are also explored.}",

Now continuous estimates at endpoints are achievable. Under given conditions the use of those quite different weighting functions at an interior point is equivalent. At a boundary point the use of dierent methods will lead to different estimates. It is also shown that the optimal weighting function at the endpoints is a natural extension of one of the optimal weighting functions in the interior. Furthermore, it is shown that the most well known boundary kernels proposed in the literature can be generated by local polynomial regression using corresponding weighting functions. The proposals are particularly useful, when one-side smoothing or de- tection of change points in nonparametric regression are considered.},
